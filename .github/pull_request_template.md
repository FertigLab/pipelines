This is a code review template, it will be displayed after each pull request. We do code reviews because we care about quality of our codebase and because we care about long-term development goals. We do not do code reviews to blame the ones who contribute. There is no seniority in this process and there is no perfect code, we just want to avoid storing code that is not OK.
